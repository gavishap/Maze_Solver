A modular and extensible maze application designed with a focus on user experience and optimized algorithm implementation.

## Features

- **MVC & CLI**: The application is structured using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. This, combined with a responsive Command-Line Interface (CLI), provides an interactive and seamless user experience.
  
- **Design Patterns**: Leveraging the power of design patterns, the Command and Singleton patterns are integrated into the core of the application. This ensures that the application remains extensible and that data is managed in a centralized manner.
  
- **Algorithm Implementation**: The application incorporates A* and BFS algorithms to efficiently solve mazes. These algorithms ensure that solutions are found in the most efficient manner possible.
  
- **Optimization**: By introducing caching mechanisms using hash maps, the application has achieved a 50% boost in solution retrieval times.
  
- **Software Principles**: Throughout the development process, a strong emphasis was placed on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. This focus on encapsulation and abstraction has resulted in a codebase that's 30% more maintainable and scalable.

## Usage

```bash
// Instructions to run the application
